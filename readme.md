Dot Emacs 
==========

This repository contains my .emacs file.
It builds on the work of many others, including
[Sacha Chua](https://github.com/sachac),
[Xah Lee](https://github.com/xahlee), and
[John Wiegley](https://github.com/jwiegley).

* The code is reasonably well documented with links to sources for the
  things I am using.

* I have recently started using John Wiegley's use-package for loading
  packages.  Not everything is converted and I may convert other package to
  load this way.

* I run Emacs on both Windows and Mac machines so some of the code uses
  conditional tests to see which machine it is running on and take
  different action on each.
